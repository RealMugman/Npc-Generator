# Npc-Generator
1. The code uses several input statements to get ranges for the random generation of npc attributes
###  
``` ArL = int(input('Enter lowest possible age for NPC: '))```

2. Then the code takes a list of many possible names for a random.choice statement.
###    
``` NpcNames = ['name', 'name', 'name'...] ```

3. The code then uses many lists for name, age, health, attack, and exp level which are randomly generated
###   
``` NpcN = [], for i in range(10): NpcN.append(random.choice(NpcNames) ```

4. After all of this, the code then prints all the lists out
###   
``` for i in range(10): print(lists) ```
